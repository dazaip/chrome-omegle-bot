# Chrome Omegle Bot

I never thought I'd be working on this project again, but here I am with yet another iteration. This is a fully fledged Omegle bot Chrome extension.

## Features

- Updates the message + config realtime, meaning no need to restart the script
- Stop and restart the script at will at any time
- Count of the total number of sent messages
- Detects if it's been skipped and handles those cases
- Waits for chat to connect before typing and sending a message

## Installation

Download the contents of this repository, then in Chrome head to `chrome://extensions/`.

Be sure **Developer Mode** is on, click on **Load Unpacked** and load this folder. Done!

Don't forget to pin the extension for easy access to its super pro popup interface.
